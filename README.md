## My work in project

During the summer, I spent my time around contributing to Sugar. My work revolved around refactoring, improving, adding new features, enhancing the UI in different activities. Project also involved some reviewing of PRs, fixing flake8 warnings and solving issues which were blocking new releases, and making new releases. I learnt alot during this process about python, pygame, GTK +3, sugargame, sugar and it's working, etc.

## Personal Note
With GSoC'23 coming to an end, I'd like to thank my mentors Ibiam Chihurumnaya and Sourabha G for guiding me all along. I really enjoyed working on these activities and I will be continuing my contribution to Sugar Labs. ðŸš€
